# Json Parse

#### Todo:
- [ ] Main functionality
    - [x] opening files
    - [X] fix tree data passing for array ( getData() )
    - [ ] Implement data input
      - [ ] validation
      - [ ] saving data in tree
    - [ ] manipulating data
    - [ ] display data in good way "pretty"
- [ ] Unit testing
    - [X] Check out library
    - [ ] save data
    - [ ] manipulation
- [ ] Examples
- [ ] Documentation

simple fixes:
- [ ] fix the file system to name with spaces
- [ ] rewrite error messages to be outside the library

#### Notes:
- files needed to be reopened if changed
- Current data display kinda works, but need validator
- Validator needs to check 2 things - if key-value is correct, brackets.
- Concepts/test4.cpp - the tree memory system
- Concepts/test2.cpp - void casting
